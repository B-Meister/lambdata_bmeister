Solid code! Very clear code, with good documentation! 
### Overall Score: 2

Your code is nice and clean. Great job cutting out any excess!

I like the touch you added at the end with the print statement. However, you
might want to put it in one of your functions. Alternatively, if you wanted to
make a class and move both of your functions in there along with the print statement
you could. Otherwise, it's just going to print immediately when the file is run.

You also might want to move them to a separate file outside of __init__.py but
still in the project root. The __init__.py is mostly there to tell whatever
REPL that your files are a package.

Definitely a solid base though! I'm always a fan of getting some automation in
for data splitting. That can be a pain haha.
